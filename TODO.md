# Cinematic 3D Cricket Intro Animation - Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Setup & Dependencies ✅
- [x] Install Three.js ecosystem and animation libraries
- [x] Configure project structure
- [x] Setup TypeScript types

## Phase 2: Core Application Structure ✅
- [x] Create main application layout
- [x] Setup main page with animation trigger
- [x] Configure Next.js app structure

## Phase 3: 3D Scene Foundation ✅
- [x] Create main cricket animation component
- [x] Setup basic Three.js scene with lighting
- [x] Implement camera system with dynamic controls
- [x] Add stadium environment and atmosphere

## Phase 4: Character & Equipment Modeling ✅
- [x] Create realistic batsman character model
- [x] Design cricket bat with wood texture and leather grip
- [x] Model cricket ball with red leather and white stitching
- [x] Implement proper material properties and textures

## Phase 5: Physics & Animation System ✅
- [x] Integrate physics engine for realistic ball trajectories
- [x] Implement bat swing mechanics with proper timing
- [x] Create character animations and body movements
- [x] Add collision detection for bat-ball impact

## Phase 6: Camera Choreography ✅
- [x] Design dynamic camera movements and angles
- [x] Implement smooth transitions between shots
- [x] Add camera shake effects for impact moments
- [x] Create cinematic framing and composition

## Phase 7: Visual Effects & Lighting ✅
- [x] Setup sunset/golden hour lighting system
- [x] Implement post-processing effects (bloom, motion blur)
- [x] Add atmospheric effects and stadium lighting
- [x] Create realistic shadows and reflections

## Phase 8: Text Reveal System ✅
- [x] Design animated typography for "TANISH CREATES"
- [x] Implement smooth fade-in and scale effects
- [x] Add text glow and overlay effects
- [x] Create final composition transition

## Phase 9: Image Processing (AUTOMATIC) ✅
- [x] **AUTOMATIC**: No placeholder images detected - skipping this step
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

## Phase 10: Testing & Optimization ✅
- [x] Build and test application
- [x] Optimize performance for smooth animation
- [x] Test across different devices and browsers
- [x] Validate API endpoints and functionality

## Phase 11: Final Deployment ✅
- [x] Start development server
- [x] Conduct final testing and validation
- [x] Generate preview URL for demonstration
- [x] Document usage and features
